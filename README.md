this is my personal site. Github lets me host it for free so long as the source is public. 
If you want to visit it just go to "peptobepto.com" 
I update it whenever I feel like it or if I've done something new i want to show off. 
don't worry script kiddies and wannabe hackers, you cant deface this just by submitting a pull request (and Its hosted on githubs servers and protected by cloudfare so good luck trying to ddos it)
ok thats all.
